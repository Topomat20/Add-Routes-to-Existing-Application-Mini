# Add-Routes-to-Existing-Application-Mini
Adding routes to an existing application.
## Description
I will add routes to an existing application, and create one wildcard route for serving up a 404 page, as well as a diagnostics route for logging failed form validation.

    * As a developer, I want to be able to add routes to an existing application.

    * As a developer, I want to serve up a custom 404 page when the requested resource doesn't exist.

    * As a developer, I want to log usage statistics from users of my site.

    * As a developer, I want to be able to deploy my apps to Heroku.
